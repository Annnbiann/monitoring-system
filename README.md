## Purpose of the Project
The LU Postgraduate Monitoring System project aims to automate the monitoring process for over 100 postgraduate students in the PhD program at the Faculty of Environment, Society, and Design. The current manual system is inefficient and lacks visibility.
The project will develop a web application that allows students, supervisors, convenors, administrators, and the PG Chair to access and manage information. Students can fill out 6-month reports, supervisors can review and complete sections, convenors can update student status, and administrators can track progress and generate reports. The system aims to improve efficiency, provide timely reminders, and facilitate early intervention for struggling students.
